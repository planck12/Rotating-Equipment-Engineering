# Rotating Equipment Causality Analysis

**Author:** Umeet Bhachu, P.Eng, PMP, CMRP  
**Role:** Professional Engineer – Rotating Equipment  

This repository hosts technical articles on nonlinear causality, transfer entropy,
and industrial time-series analysis applied to rotating equipment and turbomachinery.
It combines practical condition monitoring applications for plant asset reliability
with modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to improve
system-level understanding and decision-making.
